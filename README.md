# SPSToolbox

The **_SPSToolbox_** is a java application used to create paths and areas, and generate _pascal-like_ code that is interpreted by [Simba](https://github.com/MerlijnWajer/Simba). It is designed to be used with the [SRL Positioning System](https://github.com/SRL/SPS) (SPS) - a system used to find the player's location and navigate through the MMORPG Runescape.

>The **_SPSToolbox_** is based on the [SPS-Code-Generator](https://github.com/m34tcode/SPS-Code-Generator) created by _m34tcode_
